## API Keys

InkLink uses API key authentication for all API requests. You'll receive two sets of credentials:

| Environment    | Key Format         | Usage                    |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Sandbox**    | `secret_test_xxxx` | Development and testing  |
| **Production** | `secret_live_xxxx` | Live production requests |

## Security Requirements

**⚠️ Important Security Guidelines:**

- API keys must **only be used server-side**
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- All API requests must include the authentication
  header:
  `x-api-key: secret_xxx`

## Requesting Access

To obtain API credentials:

1. Contact the InkLink team
2. Specify your intended use case
3. Receive sandbox and production keys

_Note: Self-service key management will be available in the admin dashboard in a future release._
